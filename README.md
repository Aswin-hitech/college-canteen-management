*****College Canteen Management System*****
Inspiration: This idea was inspired by the challenges I personally faced in the crowded college canteen.
	     It's aimed at streamlining the process for students who have already ordered and paid for their food, making takeaways quicker and more organized..

Project Overview:

This is a Python-based Canteen Management Application designed for college use. It allows:

- Admins (Canteen Owners) to update the menu and view all student orders.
- Students to view the menu, place pre-orders, and make payments.

- View all orders placed by students.

Student Panel:

- Login using Student ID (validation included).
- View current canteen menu with availability and prices.
- Place pre-orders with online payment simulation.

Technologies Used:

- Programming Language: Python
- Library: tabulate (for formatted table output)
- Concepts: Dictionaries, Functions, Input Validation, Loops

---

ðŸ“‚ How to Run

1. Install required library:

pip install tabulate
